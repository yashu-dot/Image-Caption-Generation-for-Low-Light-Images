Code Execution: The file named “PW22PRD01_Testing.ipynb” has all the modules of
code included in it. Please run the notebook to execute all the modules and generate
the captions for low light images.
a. Flow of execution:
i. The images are loaded into train and test dataset.
ii. Attached captions are processed using text vectorisation
iii. The Encoder-Decoder architecture is defined and initialized.
iv. “generate_captions()” function can be used to generate captions for
images in test dataset.
